## Global

All properties are little-endian.

## Records and Sections

The file contains records and sections, identified by a 2-byte id field.

If `id < 0x4000`, then this is a record. The length of the record is given by a 2-byte field length field following the id.

If `id >= 0x4000`, then this is a section marker. Sections have no length. A section contains records (and sub-sections) and continues until it encounters a record with `id == startId + 0x2000`.
